## autoCalendar

I've always wanted an auto resizing calendar based on the year and month I want. Particularly, I've wanted this in Google Sheets. 

Why?

So I can print it off and have it take up as much of as A4 page as required.

Now I've done it.

Here's the gist for it: <https://gist.github.com/LockeBirdsey/746c0f99b3b75960c8bc9b6d86a0f576>

Now I have an infinite calendar that can be printed. Yay?
