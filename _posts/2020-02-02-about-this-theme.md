## I rather like this theme.
Although it has some serious issues. And in this post I will discuss what they are and how I fixed them.

Upfront though, I am not a front-end person. Never have been, don't think it's possible. But the things I wanted to fix were easy.

1. Line-breaks and double-spaces

So this was a very annoying issue that I kinda didn't realise existed until about a week of using this them.
