## Reclaiming Fibres

Many eons ago, I used to make interactive fiction.  
I was good at it.

So I'm trying to get them back up and working again. And boyyy is it taking a while. So I might run through the steps.

# From Twine 1 to Twine 2

Fibres was made a long time ago (2012 or 2013). Twine 1 (or more importantly Twee2) was the cutting edge. The story format (Sugarcube) had some limitations, so custom macros were all the rage.
