## Icons icns ico

There's 2 more gists that should make life much easier for me and potentially others.  
They're all about making icons from a simple PNG. For both macOS(icns) and Windows(ico). The ico gist can also be used to make favicons, which is a nice additional feature.

I have to get testing these things on Windows (and no, not just WSL) rather soon.
