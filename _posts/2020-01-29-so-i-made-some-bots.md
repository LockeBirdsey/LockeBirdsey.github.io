## So I Made Some Twitter Bots...

I got rather bored last night and made some bots. I've been meaning to do this for > years.

- Number 1: easy. Simple set of corpora, generate a (mostly) logical sentence and post.
- Number 2: less easy. Download tweets from x accounts, merge tweets, use a markov chain, generate shitposts.



I think I have ideas for more. I have a weird idea for something as well.
