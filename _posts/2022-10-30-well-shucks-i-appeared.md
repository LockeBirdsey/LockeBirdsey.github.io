## Waooh

I don't appear very often, especially here BUT since the last post:
* Got job at Elisa Polystar
* I tried to make a VIC-20 emulator. It kinda worked until trying to get keyboard stuff to behave but you it runs VIC-20 stuff which is nice. Also it was written in Kotlin because work got me on that bandwagon.
* Promoted to senior developer


That's about it considering the purpose of this blog.

SO SO SO SO SO SO

What am I doing outside of work for dev things?
Well, I'm trying to think of a project that uses:

* Rust
* Wasm
* Typescript
* RabbitMQ
* AWS

Apart from that, I have nooooooo idea what to do. Maybe I'll write and discuss ideas here.

Assuming I remember that here is here.

Until then..
