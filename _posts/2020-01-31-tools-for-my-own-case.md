## Tools for my own case

This is hosted on Github Pages.
I have 3 other sites hosted on neocities. They have a nice little tool (Neocities-CLI) that allows me to push stuff directly to the respective site directory.  
But Neocities-CLI only supports a /single/ site. I got bored today and decided to extend it to allow for infinite users. Following their practices, keys are in plaintext (yuck) but I can't really think of another way to do it.

I'll eventually submit a pull request when I'm happy with it.  
It was actually my first time writing in Ruby. But picking up new languages is easy.
